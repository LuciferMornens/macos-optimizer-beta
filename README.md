## Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS 10.15 or later
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Rust (will be installed automatically if needed)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macos-optimizer.git
cd macos-optimizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Building for Production

1. Make the build script executable:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

2. Run the build script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

3. The built application will be available in:
```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/macOS Optimizer.app
```

4. Drag the app to your Applications folder to install.

## Usage

### Dashboard
The main dashboard provides an overview of your system's current state:
- Memory usage and pressure
- CPU utilization
- Disk space
- System uptime

Click "Quick Optimize" for one-click optimization.

### Memory Management
Navigate to the Memory tab to:
- View detailed memory statistics
- Optimize memory with advanced techniques
- Clear inactive memory
- Monitor swap usage

### Storage Cleaner
In the Storage tab:
1. Click "Scan System" to identify cleanable files
2. Review the files by category
3. Select files to clean
4. Click "Clean Selected" to free up space

### Process Manager
The Processes tab allows you to:
- View all running processes
- Sort by CPU or memory usage
- Search for specific processes
- Terminate unresponsive processes

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri framework
- **System Integration**: Native macOS APIs via sysinfo crate

### Key Technologies
- **Tauri**: Cross-platform desktop app framework
- **Rust**: Systems programming for performance
- **sysinfo**: System information gathering
- **walkdir**: Efficient file system traversal
- **libc**: Low-level system calls

### Security
- Sandboxed application environment
- Safe file deletion with trash support
- Protected system files cannot be deleted
- Memory optimization uses safe techniques

## Safety Features

The app includes multiple safety mechanisms:
- **Protected Files**: Never deletes critical system files
- **Trash Support**: Files are moved to trash, not permanently deleted
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Requires user confirmation for destructive actions
- **Safe Memory Management**: Uses macOS-approved optimization techniques

## Performance

- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint
- **Fast Scanning**: Efficient file system traversal
- **Real-time Updates**: Live system statistics without performance impact
- **Native Performance**: Rust backend ensures optimal speed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Some operations may require administrator privileges
2. **Build Errors**: Ensure you have the latest Xcode Command Line Tools
3. **Memory Optimization Limited**: Some features work better with sudo access

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug npm run tauri dev
```
