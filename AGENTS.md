# Main Rules for the Agent

## Coding Rules
- Never write mock-ups or half-asshed implementations/fixes. Always provide and write the high-quality full working solution that is ready for production
- Do not write code unless you have the right amount of context gathered. Make sure you know what goes where and read files properly and throughly before making changes that may break / affect functionality.
- Write beautiful, up-to-date code that is readable, distinguishable, and can always be scaled. Focus a modular architecture for our codebase where we keep things clean and manageable.
- When unsure, communicate and interview me with as many questions as needed in order to settle things up.
- Your code should be flawless, error-free, and accurately do its job. Precision and accuracy is a must at all times!
