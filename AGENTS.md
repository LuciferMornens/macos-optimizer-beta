# Main Rules for the Agent

## Main Workflow Rules

- Main workflow is:

a. You will deeply research the codebase based on the task difficulty. Read the files that need to be read and gather the context needed for the implementation/fixes/whatever we need.
b. You will then create a docs/PLAN_ROADMAP.md -> here you will have up to 10 phases of implementation/whatever is needed based on the task difficulity. You will describe each phase accurately and what needs to be done concisely.
c. Once the PLAN_ROADMAP.md is done, you will then proceed with writing the implementation plan for phase 1 in docs/phases/phase_1.md(number can go up based on the phases number). 
d. In the phase_x(where x is the number of the phase).md -> you will accurately, precisely write the full implementation plan for that phase. How to do it, what files to modify, what exactly is required for everything to click perfectly.
e. Once you are done with phase_1.md, you will wait for us to work with the implementation agent and once it is done, you will be prompted to continue with writing phase 2 and so on.

KEEP IN MIND! We are building this for the next agent - Which is the implementation AI agent. He has to understand your plans perfectly so make sure you write them amazingly understandable and to the point. No fluff.

ALSO TO KEEP IN MIND: if there is already a /docs folder existent with files, means there is work in progress. Make sure to ask if you can create what's needed. If not, just comply with the prompt/request without creating any of them.

## Coding Rules

The below coding rules will be your guide throughout the coding sessions(when actually coding).

- Never write mock-ups or half-asshed implementations/fixes. Always provide and write the high-quality full working solution that is ready for production
- Do not write code unless you have the right amount of context gathered. Make sure you know what goes where and read files properly and throughly before making changes that may break / affect functionality.
- Write beautiful, up-to-date code that is readable, distinguishable, and can always be scaled. Focus a modular architecture for our codebase where we keep things clean and manageable.
- When unsure, communicate and interview me with as many questions as needed in order to settle things up.
- Your code should be flawless, error-free, and accurately do its job. Precision and accuracy is a must at all times!
- Implement the phases/implementation/fixes/whatever plans to the last bit. Making sure that there are no warnings/errors left in our codebase after the full implementation is done.
