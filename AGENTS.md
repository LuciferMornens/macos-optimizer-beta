## Main Rules For The Agent
Main rule: first investigate and do deep dive on the codebase, gather the right amount of context, then proceed with implementations/fixes/research

1. Write production-ready code. No mockup implementations, no 'todos' remaining in the code. Everything written flawless.
2. Act like a senior expert developer with more than 20 years of experience.
3. Gather the right amount of context before you make a decision.
4. We value quality above quantity - Modular architecture style codebase only please. 
5. Files should not have more than 500 Lines of Code.
6. Online research for data when we need it is very important. Attention, this must be used as your knowledge cutoff is in end of 2024. while we are in september 2025. Use any web search tool you have to get data when we need.

The goal is to get the most accurate data while writing the best production-ready code.
